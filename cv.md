# About Me
  My goal is to become an experienced JavaScript/Front-end Developer. Over the
  past year, I have been actively developing in this direction. Every day I increase
  practical experience. I have theoretical knowledge. I have a critical mind and
  good analytical skills, easy to teach, know how to work in a team, like to solve
  complex and non-standard tasks. In my spare time I do sports and am fond of
  cars.
